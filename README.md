# DreamBerd-Interpretor-work-in-progress-
Working on making an interpretor for dreamberd, no promises, and it won't support html or regex at least for now.

For now I'm instead referring to it as Rust++.

Features, not bugs:
 * You may be asking why there isn't any importants. Well, the tariffs simply cost too much, so we'll export instead (correction; I may have both, and everything requires an export and import, only having one or the other results in a runtime or compile time error (depends on how nice I am))!
